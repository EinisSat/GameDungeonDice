This game was made by me to hone my skills, therefore it is largely unfinished and only features basic implementations of several features.
This was also my first time creating a turn based system with multiple combatants, which was entirely created by me, starting from a basic 1v1 turn based combat tutorial.

<CONTROLS>
-DUNGEON CRAWL MODE-
W - Walk forwards
A - Strafe left
S - Walk backwards
D - Strafe right
Q - Turn left
E - Turn right
F - Interact
-COMBAT MODE-
LEFT CLICK - select which allies to select, enemies to attack and  to roll dice
-DEV KEYBINDS-
Z and X - to immediately start and end the placeholder combat encounter

<THINGS OF NOTE>
While in combat, the triangles under the enemies are there to signal to you which character they are about to attack.
This is meant to help you better prepare and to better use what dice you are given.

Should you lose combat, you won't immediately lose the game.
Instead, you will lose some health in the dungeon crawl mode.
Winning combat will heal you instead.
However, if you run out of health while exploring, then it will be game over.
